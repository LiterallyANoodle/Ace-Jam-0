Acerola Game Jam 0 Submission titled "Crumbling Castle"

This game is not complete to the degree that I desire, but functional nonetheless.

The idea for this game was directly inspired by "Crumbling Castle" by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard which is also the track heard in the game.
(The failure track was made by me though.)
((And everything else.))
